# DIFT204-2S23
DIFT204: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Course Description:
* You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow, basic defined data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?


* Writing large programs! You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software focusing on Unit Testing or Test Driven Development, Object-Oriented Concept and  Data Structures & Algorithms
  
* This course will cover abstract data types and basics of algorithms, Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs. Students will also be taught how to derive big-Oh analysis of basic algorithms. All assignments will be in Rust as way to introduce you to a new language. Programming languages are just tools to translate our ideas in practice, so students are encourage to use any language of choice to implement their ideas.
