# Course Syllabus
## Course Description:
* You know the basics of programming. You're proficient in variables, functions, control flow, basic defined data structures, and file IO. With these concepts, you can train a computer to complete nearly any task you can imagine. So what's next?


* Writing large programs! You will learn how to write and organize large pieces of software focusing on Unit Testing or Test Driven Development, Object-Oriented Concept and  Data Structures & Algorithms
  
* This course will cover abstract data types and basics of algorithms, Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs. Students will also be taught how to derive big-Oh analysis of basic algorithms. All assignments will be in Rust as way to introduce you to a new language. Programming languages are just tools to translate our ideas in practice, so students are encourage to use any language of choice to implement their ideas.

## Prerequisites
* Introductory programming course


## Course Announcements
All the course announcement and additional materials or tutorials to help you learn the cource will be posted in the blog page of the course website. 


##  Homework late policy
Every assignment in this course is due at exactly the time stated and while I will
grade late assignments, there will be a marks deduction.

## Evaluation
The course evaluation will be a weighted mask score on class attenance and participation, homework, quizes, projects and exams.
